Yesterday was. Wow. When I called her at 11:04AM I didn't expect to end up back in my bed, wondering what I had done it all for. Four hours went by where she yelled at me, I was disgruntled back, we laughed,, we cried - we cried a lot. She can't be with me because she can't do long-distance anymore and she can't deal with my family. But she won't end it because she can't let me go. Because I give her everything she could possibly want except for physically being there and having white parents.

I thought it'd be easier to tell her to break up with me. I thought it'd be less painful.

Fuck Ethan. Motherfucker sees me sitting outside and stays in the room til 4:30 to play TFT with a dude on campus. I should've just asked for the room - I know I'm stacking and projecting my feelings but man.
