I'm starting to question whether I should transfer or not. I have a lot here, a lot more than I think I realized. A lot of what I have is not easily replaceable at UW. I think I was driven by loneliness, which is valid but somehow less applicable now? I think what I'm beginning to realize is I projected social perfection at UW because I'd have Ash and Advay (and Ella) and there would be zero drawbacks but what I'm now realizing is that 
1. Ella might be a negative (and she genuinely could be because I can't deal with the status quo)
2. There's a lot about UCSC **professionally** that I would be missing out on
