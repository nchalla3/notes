It's an odd numbered date, so of course Naveen is journaling. Today my sister asked if me and Ella were okay.  My heart dropped and I didn't know what to say. I told her the truth and said I wasn't sure and probably not, that I expected we'd be broken up by the time June ends. I think the two weeks are pointless, and she won't give me the time of day or if she does it'll be disconnected and distant and weird and I'm going to have to fight my ass off again. It's almost over. We'll see how things go in this coming week - my finals aren't til next week and I know she doesn't have much, so I guess we'll see how much she wants to be with me. I could just stay in Santa Cruz........
