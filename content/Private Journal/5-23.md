What am I supposed to do, when the best part of me was always you?

In Santa Cruz, in my friend group back home - save for a select few circles, I'm the guy with a girlfriend. That ole dude in the cutesy pie relationship: "Oh he's doing long-distance? Damn but he makes it work! What a cute couple". The perfect exception that proves the rule, that long-distance never works. My closest friend here thinks of friendship as a collective between me and her. A unit, inseparable except by 881 miles. I think of Feel Good Friday my senior year after *The Addams Family*, what did people say? "You're so good for Ella" "You make Ella so happy" "She's in a much better place now". They all told me how much they loved her, and me by some perverse proxy. 

It's tech week for yet another show and I don't know why I'm surprised. I'm not surprised. She'll text me in the morning and respond with one line texts, and maybe I'll get a 5 minute call at the end of the day. 

I can't have emotions. I can't feel things and she won't respond the way that I do.
